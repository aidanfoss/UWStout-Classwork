A family tree is a tree, but it is not a binary or binary search tree in the traditional graphic
	-a couple can have more than two kids, therefore it cant be binary
	-children come from a couple, not a single person, so it cant be a binary tree because of that either
		(unless you have a tree that ignores one of the parents each time)
	
	-this would be a binary search tree if you go backwards, a single person has 2 parents, and each of them have 2 parents
		root would be the youngest descendant, and its leaves are their parents

an org chart could be a binary tree, if its in terms of teams instead of individuals
	-a manager could manage more than 2 different people at a time, if the individuals are reduced down to a team
		element, then it could work
	-it works better if you go backwards, so from a team as the root down the list of bosses
		(on second thought it works with an individual as the root)
			each leaf is a boss/manager

a bracket is a tree if you go backwards, each game has one winner and one loser
	-would not work in a binary or binary search tree, because there are duplicate values
	-a winning team plays again, and again, and again, so the hash would be reused

	root would be the winner of the final game, if it were possible, and its leaves are the 2 teams from the game before
