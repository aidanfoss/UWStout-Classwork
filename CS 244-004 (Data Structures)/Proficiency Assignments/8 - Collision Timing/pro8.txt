after 10000 simulations
the avg for the first collision is 7.4122 inputs
the avg num of inputs before x29 chain is	579.786
avg num of inputs before loadfac of 0.9 is 27 inputs (this is due to my rounding, not sure what to do)
avg num of inputs before loadfac of 1 is 29 inputs (this makes sense, 29inputs/29buckets = 1, it would always be 29)
